## About Me

<img src="img/mmc.jpeg" width="180" align="right">

I am an economics student interested in financial economics, political economy, and applied econometrics, with a focus on financial risk, banking regulation, and macro-financial stability.
I am fluent in French and English, speak Dutch, and I am currently learning German and Spanish. 

I am particularly drawn to work that critically examines how markets, institutions, and public policies interact where Reading plays an important role in how I develop ideas, and authors like **Joseph Stiglitz** have shaped the way I think about inequality, regulation, financial instability, and the role of the state. Books such as *People, Power, and Profits*, *Globalization and Its Discontents*, *The Price of Inequality*, and *Freefall* have strongly influenced my academic interests.

Outside of academic work, I enjoy writing for myself, following football, modelling and watching anime. I value time spent with family, traveling, and organizing gatherings, as they help me maintain balance alongside my studies. I try to approach both my academic and personal life with curiosity, discipline, and openness to learning.

My academic interests lie in applied econometrics, public policy evaluation, and financial systems, and I am currently exploring how climate transition policies affect European banks.

## Current Research Project

### Climate Transition Risks and Bank Capital Dynamics in Europe

This project studies how European banks adjust capital buffers, leverage, and balance sheets in response to climate transition policies.
