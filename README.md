I’m Christianne Madina, an economics student interested in understanding how banks, public policies, and incentives interact in practice, especially when regulation meets real-world behavior.

I aspire to become an economist with a strong finance background, with a focus on financial risk, banking regulation, and macro-financial stability.

I am fluent in French and English, speak Dutch, and I am currently learning German and Spanish.

My academic interests lie in applied econometrics, public policy evaluation, and financial systems, and I am currently exploring how climate transition policies affect European banks.

## 🧰 Tools & Methods

- **R** — econometrics & policy evaluation  
- **Python** — data analysis, financial and macro-financial dynamics  
- **SAS** — regulatory-style datasets and institutional analysis
- **Excel / PowerPoint** - data handling, visualization, and reporting

## Projects


## 📚 Reading & Intellectual Influences
I am an avid reader of economics and political economy, particularly works that critically examine how markets and institutions function.

Some books that have shaped my thinking:

- People, Power, and Profits — Joseph Stiglitz
- Globalization and Its Discontents — Joseph Stiglitz
- The Price of Inequality — Joseph Stiglitz
- Freefall — Joseph Stiglitz
- The Richest Man in Babylon
- La finance contre le dérèglement climatique

Joseph Stiglitz’s work has strongly influenced how I think about inequality, regulation, financial instability, and the role of the state.

## ✍️ What I enjoy doing
When I’m not reading or coding, you’ll probably find me:
- watching football
- watching animes
- writing for myself
- Being with my family traveling and organising parties

##  En bref (FR)
Je suis Christianne Madina, étudiante en économie, intéressée par l’économétrie appliquée, la régulation bancaire et les politiques publiques, notamment dans le cadre de la transition climatique en Europe.

J’utilise principalement R, Python et SAS pour analyser des données économiques et financières.
