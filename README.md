## Hi there 👋

I’m **MADINA Christianne**, an economics student who likes understanding how banks, policies, and incentives actually work especially when regulation meets real-world behavior.
I express myself perfectly in French and English, I speak dutch as well and I am learning German and spanish

I enjoy applied econometrics, public policy, and financial systems, and I’m currently exploring how climate transition policies affect European banks.

## 🧰 Tools I use

- **R** — econometrics & policy evaluation  
- **Python** — data work & financial dynamics  
- **SAS** — regulatory-style data analysis
- **Excel / PowerPoint** - data handling & reporting

## 📚 I Love Reading 
I’m a big reader, especially economics books that question how markets really function.

Some of my favorite reads:
- *People, Power, and Profits* — Joseph Stiglitz  
- *Globalization and Its Discontents* — Joseph Stiglitz  
- *The Price of Inequality* — Joseph Stiglitz  
- *Freefall* — Joseph Stiglitz  
- *The Richest Man in Babylon*  
- *La finance contre le dérèglement climatique*

Stiglitz is one of the economists who shaped the way I think about inequality, regulation, and the role of the state.

## ✍️ What I enjoy doing
When I’m not reading or coding, you’ll probably find me:
- watching football
- watching animes
- writing for myself
- Being with my family traveling and organising parties
